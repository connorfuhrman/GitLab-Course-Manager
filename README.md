# Gitlab Course Manager
The _Gitlab Course Manager_ (gcm) was created to manage a programming course which used GitLab's CI/CD pipeline as the course autograder. 
The project began at the University of Arizona in Fall 2020 when I moved the C++ programming course I taught away from ZyBooks (which had it's own autograder) and needed a way to autograde student submissions. 

## Under Construction
The repository is currently somewhat underdocumente as I've recently posted to GitHub and am working to generalize and improve the package.
This is still a work in progress but I'm hopeful that others may benefit from the capabilities and needs of others will drive further improvements. 
Contact connorfuhrman (at) email (dot) arizona (dot) edu with any questions.
